# CS305-Project

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

  Artemis Financial is a banking company that is hoping to modernize the security measures of their existing RESTful application. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

  I feel that I did well at recognizing the security risks for this business type and recommending/implementing solutions to these risks through the various checks and refactoring. Security is important in any program, especially in programs that deal with sensetive information such as this. It not only helps the wellbeing of the company to secure their information, but the customers wellbeing as well. If a company cannot keep information secure then can ruin their reputation as well as lead to legal issues. 
  
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

  The manual review was probably the most challenging aspect. It's fairly easy to look at the dependency checks or follow the vulerability flow chart, but looking at code that I don't know much about and finding flaws with it can be difficult. I feel like this is something that will require practice as I further my career.
  
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

  Multiple tools and practices were used throughout the project, such as OWASP dependecy check, the vulnerability process flow, manual code checks, SSL certification, input encryption, as well as testing to ensure refactoring works as intended. Depending on the type of project some of these tools could be used, while others cant. OWASP dependency check is definetely a tool that should be used when working with dependencies. the vulnerability process flow can work for any project. Web based projects should always use SSL certification to ensure HTTPS is utilized for security and user trust. Encryption types depend on the data used and stored within the program.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  As stated above, testing is a key part of the process of securing a program. Anytime code is changed tests should be ran to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not introduces as well as new errors or unexpected outcomes. Testing can also find issues that were missed by earlier checks, this is why testing multiple times and with multiple variables is important.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  All of the tools mentioned in the above responses were new to me and will be valuable for the future, both in my academics and career. Web development is one of the top careers for software developers at the moment, so understanding good security practices helps to set myself apart from others.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

  My work identifying vulnerabilities and plans to mitigate them using different tools and industry practices.
